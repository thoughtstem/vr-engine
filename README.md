Racket Lang for Virtual Reality (Aframe)

We made this for educational purposes at ThoughtSTEM.  We're releasing it open source because we love Racket and Aframe.io.

[Here's the racket package](https://pkgd.racket-lang.org/pkgn/package/vr-lang)

[Here are the docs](http://docs.racket-lang.org/vr-lang/index.html)
