#lang scribble/manual
 
@title{vr-engine}

This language allows declarative specification of virtual reality scenes and games.

It works by compiling down to A-frame.io -- a JavaScript/HTML framework for specifying VR
environments as entity/component systems.

The intention of this language is to wrap up A-frame and provide a more convenient way of
specifying VR scenes.
